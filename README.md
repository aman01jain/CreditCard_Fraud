Dataset used from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1
used multiple ML models fro the prediction (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) 
the model gives out good accuracy but the model is not sufficient as the data is imbalanced (number of non-fraudulent transaction are way more then fraudulent transaction )
instead confusion matrix is used to understand the False negative and True negative 
Random forest does better model creation on this type of dataset as compared to Logistic Regression
